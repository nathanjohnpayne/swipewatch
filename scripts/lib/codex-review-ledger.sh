#
# Report-only Codex review ledger (#1560, slice 2). Reconstructs, from records
# GitHub already holds, which Codex responses a PR's Codex requests drew, and
# reports every case whose attribution the record cannot prove as ambiguous
# instead of guessing. It decides nothing: no requester, barrier or
# merge-gate path reads it. Its job is to produce the evidence the counting
# and routing decision on #1560 is made from. The contract, including every
# rule below, is specs/codex_review_ledger.md.
#
# What the record does not prove, and how the ledger treats it:
#   - A request comment names no commit, so a request never gets a head from
#     timestamps. A response's head comes only from its own anchor (a review's
#     commit_id, a verdict's "Reviewed commit"); reactions and block notices
#     carry none.
#   - Anyone can request a review. Requests from other accounts, or author
#     comments that are not the exact command, are FOREIGN: they open windows
#     and are attribution candidates, but are not counted as the configured
#     author's requests (the set the request cap counts).
#   - Codex reacts with eyes while a review runs and usually removes the
#     reaction when it finishes, so eyes are current state. The ledger only
#     says eyes came before a re-post when the reaction's own timestamp proves
#     it; otherwise it says unknown.
#   - The thumbs-up on the pull request is one reaction per user: only its
#     latest creation survives, so earlier reaction-only clean passes leave no
#     record. The Review Summary is edited in place. Both are listed in
#     `limits` on every ledger.
#
# Every comment body is parsed by an existing shared helper the caller runs
# first (crqe_trigger_generation, crqe_ack_present's selection, codex_tiers_of,
# codex_tier_of, codex_failure_marker_of, crqe_verdicts,
# crqe_select_codex_review_summary). This file only orders and attributes the
# results, so it adds no second grammar.
